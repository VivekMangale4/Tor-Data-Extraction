# TOR Data Extraction 🚀  

## **Overview**  
The **Tor network** provides anonymity by routing traffic through multiple encrypted relays. However, security researchers and forensic analysts often require **insight into hidden services (.onion sites)** for **threat intelligence, OSINT, and cybersecurity investigations**.  

This project focuses on:  
✅ **Extracting data from .onion websites**  
✅ **Crawling and scraping publicly accessible dark web content**  
✅ **Analyzing metadata (domains, fingerprints, hidden links, etc.)**
